This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started


Run install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```



Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```


DO not forget to check your backend is running on port 1994. If not, you can run the backend by following the instructions in the [ai-chatbot-service]

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.




The app is based on Next.js


## To run tests use:

```bash
npm run cypress:open
# or
yarn cypress:open
```

it should open Cypress and and you can run the test against the main page.
The tests can be extended for sure. Just wanted to show the approach.

To run tests in the headless mode simply run:

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```
